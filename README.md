## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- Internet connection for API calls
- RapidAPI account (free tier available)
- **For server-side logging**: Node.js (version 14 or higher)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Server-Side Logging (Recommended)
1. **Install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **Open the application** at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Client-Side Only
1. **Open `index.html`** directly in a web browser

### API Endpoints
The server provides the following endpoints:
- **`POST /api/logs`**: Submit new log entries
- **`GET /api/logs`**: Retrieve logs with pagination

### Admin Panel
Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:3000/logs.html` to:
- View real-time logs from all users
- Monitor statistics and file sizes
- Export logs in various formats
- Clear logs when needed

### Fallback Support
If the server is unavailable, the application automatically:
